#Q - why we use dictionaries?
# A -Because of limitations of lists, lists are not enough to represent
# real data.

# Example
user = ['Harshit', 24, ['coco', 'kimi no na wa'], ['awakening', 'fairy tale']]
# this list contains user name, age, fav movies, fav tunes
# you can do this but this is not a good way to do this.

#Q what are dictionaries
# A unordered collections of data in key value pair.

# how to create dictionaries
user = {'name': 'Harshit', 'age': 24}
# print(user)
# print(type(user))
